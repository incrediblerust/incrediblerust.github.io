# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add an interactive code playground to the multilingual Rust tutorial website, allowing users to write, edit, and execute Rust code directly in their browser without needing a local Rust installation. This will significantly enhance the learning experience by providing immediate feedback and hands-on practice opportunities for students following the tutorials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student learning Rust, I want to run code examples directly in the browser, so that I can experiment with the concepts without setting up a local development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a "Run Code" button in a lesson THEN the system SHALL execute the Rust code and display the output
2. WHEN code execution completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the program output in a dedicated output panel
3. WHEN code execution fails THEN the system SHALL display compilation errors with line numbers and helpful error messages
4. WHEN a user modifies code in the playground THEN the system SHALL preserve their changes during the session
5. IF code execution takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and display an appropriate message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to edit and experiment with code examples, so that I can learn by modifying existing examples and seeing the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a lesson with code examples THEN the system SHALL provide an editable code editor with syntax highlighting
2. WHEN a user types in the code editor THEN the system SHALL provide Rust syntax highlighting and basic auto-completion
3. WHEN a user makes changes to the code THEN the system SHALL allow them to reset to the original example
4. WHEN a user wants to share their code THEN the system SHALL provide a way to generate a shareable link
5. IF the user navigates away from the page THEN the system SHALL warn them about unsaved changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a multilingual learner, I want the code playground to work consistently across all language versions of the site, so that I can have the same interactive experience regardless of my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the playground from any language version THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality
2. WHEN error messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them in the user's selected language
3. WHEN UI elements are rendered THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate translations from the existing translation system
4. WHEN a user switches languages THEN the system SHALL preserve their code and maintain the playground state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tutorial author, I want to easily embed interactive code examples in lessons, so that I can enhance the learning experience without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an author writes a lesson THEN the system SHALL support a simple markdown syntax to create interactive code blocks
2. WHEN a lesson is rendered THEN the system SHALL automatically convert marked code blocks into interactive playgrounds
3. WHEN an author specifies starter code THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the playground with that code
4. WHEN an author wants to hide certain code sections THEN the system SHALL support read-only or hidden code areas
5. IF an author specifies expected output THEN the system SHALL optionally validate user code against expected results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the playground to integrate seamlessly with the existing Jekyll architecture, so that it doesn't disrupt the current build and deployment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the site is built THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with GitHub Pages deployment
2. WHEN new playground features are added THEN the system SHALL not require server-side processing beyond static file serving
3. WHEN the playground loads THEN the system SHALL not significantly impact page load performance
4. WHEN users interact with the playground THEN the system SHALL work offline after initial page load
5. IF the playground service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to show static code examples

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student on a mobile device, I want to use the code playground on my phone or tablet, so that I can learn Rust on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the playground on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for touch
2. WHEN a user types on a mobile keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate keyboard shortcuts and code completion
3. WHEN the screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL allow collapsing/expanding of different panels (editor, output, etc.)
4. WHEN a user rotates their device THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
5. IF the device has limited processing power THEN the system SHALL still provide acceptable performance for basic code execution
