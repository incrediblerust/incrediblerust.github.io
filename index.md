## Learning Path

### 🌱 Getting Started
Perfect for complete beginners to Rust programming.

- [Installation]({{ '/lessons/installation/' | relative_url }})
- [Hello World]({{ '/lessons/hello-world/' | relative_url }})
- [Cargo Package Manager]({{ '/lessons/cargo/' | relative_url }})

### 🏗️ Rust Fundamentals
Core concepts every Rust programmer must know.

- [Variables and Mutability]({{ '/lessons/variables/' | relative_url }})
- [Data Types]({{ '/lessons/data-types/' | relative_url }})
- [Functions]({{ '/lessons/functions/' | relative_url }})
- [Control Flow]({{ '/lessons/control-flow/' | relative_url }})

### 🎯 Ownership System
Rust's unique approach to memory safety.

- [Understanding Ownership]({{ '/lessons/ownership/' | relative_url }})
- [References and Borrowing]({{ '/lessons/references/' | relative_url }})
- [Slices]({{ '/lessons/slices/' | relative_url }})

### 🔧 Building Complex Programs
Organize code and handle complexity.

- [Structs]({{ '/lessons/structs/' | relative_url }})
- [Enums and Pattern Matching]({{ '/lessons/enums/' | relative_url }})
- [Modules and Packages]({{ '/lessons/modules/' | relative_url }})
- [Error Handling]({{ '/lessons/error-handling/' | relative_url }})

## Why Learn Rust?

**Performance**: Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient with no runtime or garbage collector.

**Safety**: Rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety.

**Productivity**: Great documentation, friendly compiler with helpful error messages, and top-notch tooling.

**Community**: Growing ecosystem of libraries and active, welcoming community.

## Ready to Start?

Begin your Rust journey with our [Installation Guide]({{ '/lessons/installation/' | relative_url }}) or jump straight into [Hello World]({{ '/lessons/hello-world/' | relative_url }}) if you already have Rust installed.

Happy learning! 🦀
