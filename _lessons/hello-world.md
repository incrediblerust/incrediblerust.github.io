# Hello World

Let's write your first Rust program! Following programming tradition, we'll make a simple program that prints "Hello, world!" to the screen.

## Creating a Rust File

First, create a new directory for your Rust projects:

```bash
mkdir rust_projects
cd rust_projects
```

Now create a file called `main.rs`:

```bash
touch main.rs
```

Open `main.rs` in your favorite text editor and add the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Let's break down what this code does:

1. `fn main()` - This defines a function named `main`. The `main` function is special: it's the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.
2. `println!("Hello, world!");` - This calls the `println!` macro to print text to the screen. The `!` indicates this is a macro, not a function.

## Compiling and Running

To run this program, we need to compile it first. Rust is a compiled language, which means we need to translate our source code into machine code before we can execute it.

Compile the program:

```bash
rustc main.rs
```

This creates an executable file. On Linux and macOS, it's called `main`. On Windows, it's `main.exe`.

Run the program:

```bash
./main        # On Linux/macOS
main.exe      # On Windows
```

You should see:

```
Hello, world!
```

Congratulations! You've written and run your first Rust program!

## Understanding the Syntax

Let's examine the code more closely:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Function Definition

```rust
fn main() {
    // function body
}
```

- `fn` is the keyword for defining functions
- `main` is the function name
- `()` indicates this function takes no parameters
- `{}` contain the function body

### The println! Macro

```rust
println!("Hello, world!");
```

- `println!` is a macro that prints text to the console
- The `!` tells us this is a macro, not a function
- The text inside quotes is called a string literal
- The semicolon `;` ends the statement

## More Examples

Let's try a few variations:

### Printing Multiple Lines

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    println!("I'm learning Rust!");
    println!("This is exciting!");
}
```

### Using Variables

```rust
fn main() {
    let name = "Rustacean";
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

This introduces:
- `let` keyword for creating variables
- `{}` as a placeholder in the string
- String interpolation

### Multiple Placeholders

```rust
fn main() {
    let language = "Rust";
    let year = 2025;
    println!("I'm learning {} in {}!", language, year);
}
```

## Common Mistakes

When starting with Rust, watch out for these common issues:

### Forgetting Semicolons

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!")  // Missing semicolon - this will cause an error!
}
```

### Wrong Function Name

```rust
fn Main() {  // Capital 'M' - Rust won't recognize this as the entry point
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

The `main` function must have a lowercase 'm'.

### Forgetting the Exclamation Mark

```rust
fn main() {
    println("Hello, world!");  // Missing '!' - println is a macro, not a function
}
```

## Key Takeaways

- Every Rust program starts with a `main` function
- `println!` is used to print to the console
- Rust code must be compiled before running
- Statements end with semicolons
- Macros are called with `!`

## Next Steps

Now that you can write and run basic Rust programs, let's learn about [Cargo]({{ '/lessons/cargo/' | relative_url }}), Rust's package manager and build system, which will make managing Rust projects much easier.

## Try It Yourself

Before moving on, try these exercises:

1. Print your name instead of "world"
2. Print multiple lines with different messages
3. Create variables for your favorite programming language and the current year, then print them

Happy coding! ðŸ¦€
